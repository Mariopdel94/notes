#js-docs

A file may have a top-level `@fileoverview` JSDoc. If present, it may provide a description of the file's content, its uses, or information about its dependencies. Wrapped lines are not indented.

Example:  

```js

/**

* @fileoverview Description of file. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur

* adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.

*/

```
