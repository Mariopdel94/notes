# Variables

## Booleans

Boolean variables will mostly be used as flags, and thus they **must** start with an `is` prefix, or a [modal verb]([Modal Verbs: Definition & Usage Examples | Grammarly Blog](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/modal-verbs/)). [Action verbs]([English Grammar Rules - Do, Does, Did (gingersoftware.com)](https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/verbs/do-does-did))  can also be used, although should be avoided, preferring `is` or modal verbs.
