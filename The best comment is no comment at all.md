**The best comment is not comment at all**. Code should be self-explanatory and variable and functions declaration should display their intention through concise logic and good naming.

Comments in code are at best a "necessary evil", and the proper use of them is to compensate for our **failure to express ourself in code**.

Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression.
