Notes:
* A very big part of this CoP could be code review of existing code from members
* Shoot for getting one person from each team to be a part of this CoP

# Clean Code

[[Small things matter]]

> The smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor, or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole. That is what clean code is about.

[[Maintenance over producing]]
When we spend more of our time maintaining the codebase, we should focus more on how to facilitate it than focusing on "creating" new code. 

## Clean code
>We are going to look at code from every different direction. We’ll look down at it from the top, up at it from the bottom, and through it from the inside out. By the time we are done, we’re going to know a lot about code. What’s more, we’ll be able to tell the **difference between good code and bad code**. We’ll know how to write good code. And **we’ll know how to transform bad code into good code.**


# Angular specific
 
## Convert **imperative** code to **reactive** code.

Some of the key ideas you can use to convert imperative code to a more reactive pattern are two *Karen* inspired rules you can follow to get more into that declarative/reactive pattern mindset:

1. [[Angular - Make sure things never change]]
2. [[Angular - "I want to speak to your manager"]]
### Refactor code!
Okay, we now know that imperative is bad and we should avoid and reactive is good. But how do we apply these two rules?

1. [[Angular - Make sure things never change (Refactor)]]
2. [[Angular - "I want to speak to your manager" (Refactor)]]
